## Results

**The documented fix for a deprecation warning can break your program, and the diff will
not show it.**

Python 3.12 deprecates `datetime.utcnow()`. The documentation says to write
`datetime.now(timezone.utc)`. That is one token, it looks like a rename, and it changes a
**naive** datetime into an **aware** one. Every comparison against a naive datetime
elsewhere then raises at runtime - in a function the diff never touched.

```
$ python scripts/prove_utcnow.py

A stored naive timestamp: 2026-09-17 12:00:00 (tzinfo=None)

before the fix:
  session_expired_old(stored) -> False

after applying the documented replacement:
  TypeError: can't subtract offset-naive and offset-aware datetimes
```

So this tool classifies every rule before it will run it:

| | |
|---|---|
| **mechanical** | provably equivalent. `typing.List[int]` and `list[int]` are the same type. Applied automatically. |
| **behavioural** | what the deprecation notice tells you to write, and not the same program. Reported, never applied. |

## Measured

Across **1,675 Python files** on this machine - the whole portfolio plus the vendored
CVAT, Flask and requests checkouts:

```
files scanned = 1,675   parse errors = 0   files with edits = 12
  mechanical  =  7
  behavioural = 12
  {'utcnow-deprecated': 10, 'naive-now': 2, 'pep585-generics': 7}
```

**More of what a modernisation scan finds changes behaviour than does not.** A tool that
auto-fixed every deprecation it recognised would be making semantic changes most of the
time.

The honest caveat: 19 edits across 1,675 files is a small sample, and it is small because
the corpus is already modern. The ratio is suggestive, not established. The
`prove_utcnow.py` demonstration is the part that does not depend on sample size.

## Input / Output

**In:** a Python file, or a folder of them.

**Out:** every applicable edit, split into the ones that will be applied and the ones
that never will, each with the source text it would replace.

```
$ migration-pilot scan ~/code --verbose

pallets__flask-4045\src\flask\sessions.py
  [REVIEW] line   273  utcnow-deprecated
           datetime.utcnow()  ->  datetime.now(timezone.utc)
           utcnow() returns a NAIVE datetime; now(timezone.utc) returns an AWARE one.
           Comparing the two raises TypeError, so this is a semantic change, not a
           rename. Requires `from datetime import timezone`.

  files with edits : 12
  mechanical       : 7    (provably equivalent, safe to apply)
  behavioural      : 12   (changes meaning, never auto-applied)
```

```
$ migration-pilot apply src/            # dry run, prints a diff
$ migration-pilot apply src/ --write    # mechanical edits only, always
$ migration-pilot rules                 # every rule and its classification
$ python ui/server.py                   # API for the Vue UI on :8105
```

## Two guarantees, checked rather than assumed

**The rewrite parses.** An edit producing invalid Python is discarded and reported, never
written.

**Only annotations changed.** For mechanical rules the rewritten module must be
AST-equivalent to the original once annotations are stripped. If a rule ever altered
executable code, the file is left untouched and the rejection says so. There is a test
that sabotages an edit to prove the check fires.

## Edits are text slices, not a reformat

Locating with `ast` and applying with text offsets means a two-line change stays a
two-line diff:

```python
def f(
    a: Optional[str],  # keep this comment
    b: int = 3,
) -> List[int]:
    """Docstring stays."""
    return [1, 2]
```

becomes `a: str | None` and `-> list[int]`, with the comment, the docstring and the odd
spacing in `[1,  2]` untouched. Round-tripping through `ast.unparse` would have been
twenty lines shorter to write and would reformat every file it touched, turning a
reviewable diff into an unreviewable one.

Nested generics need more than one pass - `Dict[str, List[Optional[int]]]` produces
overlapping edits, so the innermost is applied first and the scan repeats until stable.
`--write` runs to a fixed point.

## What I wrote vs what I installed

**Installed: nothing.** `dependencies = []`. `ast` locates, `difflib` renders the dry-run
diff, `http.server` serves the API. `ast-grep` was the planned tool and was not needed -
and would not have given the mechanical/behavioural split, which is the part that
matters. Only the Vue front end needs npm.

## Scope

- **Six rules.** This is not `pyupgrade`, which has dozens. The contribution is the
  refusal, not the coverage.
- **It does not add imports.** Applying the `utcnow` fix needs
  `from datetime import timezone`; since that rule is never auto-applied, nothing here
  edits an import block.
- **It does not remove imports left unused.** After rewriting `List[int]` the
  `from typing import List` line is dead, and removing it safely needs whole-module
  reference analysis this does not do.
- **Type comments and stub files are ignored.**
- **The equivalence check only guards mechanical rules**, and only against changes to
  executable code. A mechanical rule that produced a *wrong annotation* would pass it.
- **Behavioural findings are not judgements.** `datetime.now()` with no timezone may be
  exactly right in a local-time application.

## Run it

```bash
uv run pytest -q                        # 25 tests
uv run python scripts/prove_utcnow.py   # the demonstration
uv run migration-pilot scan ~/code
uv run migration-pilot rules
uv run python ui/server.py              # then: cd ui && npm install && npm run dev
```

## Layout

```
src/pilot/
    rules.py    six rules, each classified mechanical or behavioural
    apply.py    text-slice edits, parse check, AST-equivalence check
    cli.py      argparse
scripts/prove_utcnow.py   runnable proof that the documented fix breaks code
ui/                       Vue 3 + Vite, http.server API
tests/test_rules.py       25 tests, mostly asserting what it refuses to do
```
