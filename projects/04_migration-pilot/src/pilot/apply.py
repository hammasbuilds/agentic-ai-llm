"""Apply edits to source text, then prove the result is still the same program.

Two guarantees, both checked rather than assumed:

  1. **The result parses.** An edit that produces invalid Python is discarded
     and reported, never written.
  2. **Only annotations changed.** For mechanical rules the rewritten module
     must be AST-equivalent to the original once annotations are stripped. If
     a rewrite altered executable code, that is a bug in a rule and the file
     is left untouched.

Edits are applied last-first so that earlier offsets stay valid, and
overlapping edits are resolved by keeping the innermost - nested generics like
`Dict[str, List[int]]` produce edits for both and only the inner one may be
applied in a single pass.
