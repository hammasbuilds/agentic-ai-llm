"""Adversarial verification: try to disprove every proposal before reporting it.

Each verifier is written to *defeat* its proposal, not to confirm it. A
proposal survives only if no defeater applies. Anything knocked down is
recorded with the reason, because the retraction rate is the number this
project is built to measure - a reviewer that posts plausible-looking noise
gets muted on the second day, and precision is the entire product.

Verifiers look at the whole file, not the changed hunk. That is the point:
most false positives are false because of something the diff did not show.
