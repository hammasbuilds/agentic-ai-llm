"""Score how risky a change is, from diff statistics rather than from opinion.

The whole argument of this module is that no single number works. A commit of
47,743 lines across 5 files is a generated data dump and carries almost no
review risk. A commit of 5,442 lines across 693 files is a broad structural
change and carries a great deal. Ranked by lines, the first looks nine times
worse. Ranked by spread, the second does.

So risk is a small vector reduced to a score with stated weights, and the
factors are reported alongside the number. A gate that says "risk 78" and will
not say why is not a gate, it is an oracle.
